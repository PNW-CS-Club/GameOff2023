## Build Requirements
Unity Version: 2022.3.11f1
VS Code with Unity Extension or Visual Studio

## Steps to Set Up Project
If you would like to use VS Code as your editor then first have that installed otherwise, install the Unity Hub first. Once the Unity Hub is installed, install Unity version 2022.3.11f1. When installing, choose Visual Studio or VS Code as your default script editor, this will install Visual Studio automatically if it is not already installed. Then, I would recommend installing Github Desktop. Through Github Desktop, clone this repository into a folder on your computer. This will allow you to then open the project folder on Unity Hub.
